# Choropleth Maps

This is a project to learn how to plot choropleth maps. The data I will be using here is the GDP per capita and wealth of countries in 2015. I will plot this data on a world map with varying colors to see if there are any relationships between the wealth and health of countries or continents in 2015. Then, there will be an evaluation at the end where I not only analyse the findings of the choropleth map plots, but evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of this type of plot.
