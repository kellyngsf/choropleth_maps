# Choropleth Maps

This is a project to learn how to plot choropleth maps. The data I will be using here is the GDP per capita and wealth of countries in 2015. I will plot this data on a world map with varying colors to see if there are any relationships between the wealth and health of countries or continents in 2015. Then, there will be an evaluation at the end where I not only analyse the findings of the choropleth map plots, but evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of this type of plot.

# Conclusions
- The continent with the lowest wealth and health values is Africa, in terms of their GDP per capita and life expectancy at birth, respectively. 
- In general, Latin American countries are around the middle range in terms of wealth and health. 
- North American countries have both high wealth and health. 
- Asian countries are generally heterogenous, for instance, Japan and South Korea are both wealthy and live longer lives. 
- Overall, there is a correlation between GDP per-capita and average life expectancy; as wealth (GDP per capita) increases, health (life expectancy) also increases. 

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Choropleth Maps
- Points representing each country do not overlap with each other, making it easy to see each individual country on a map. 
- One cannot tell the exact value of GDP per capita and life expectancy a country has because the values are plotted as a range (i.e., 60 - 65 years life expectancy).
- A reader will have to shift their attention between the two figures to observe a relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy because they are in two different plots. We can solve this problem if we had an interactive map rather than a printed one, where a viewer can toggle between two variables.
